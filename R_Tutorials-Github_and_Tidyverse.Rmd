# Github and Tidyverse


This tutorial was taken from our coding club from Univ of Ettinburough

I lost the notes I was taking on it at first 
Basically Github is great and allows for version control 

With new repo you 
commit - publish firle to Github for 1st time 
pull - take file from github 
push - put changes on file up onto Github 


This project is synced with Github

##Once is synced there are changes on the doc 
  Top left - working directory name 
  Top right - new git tab - allows for version control 
  Bottom Right - all files from github are now on computer too 
  
  I am having problems with Git not wanting to see the files I am working on 
  
  I moved this file to the git folder on my computer but it is still not working 
  
  
  


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
